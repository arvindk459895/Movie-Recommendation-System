Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that can provide movie recommendations to users based on their past viewing history and preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to generate recommendations for users.

Collaborative filtering is a technique that uses the past behavior of users to generate recommendations. It identifies users who have similar preferences and recommends movies that they have liked in the past. Content-based filtering, on the other hand, recommends movies based on their attributes such as genre, cast, and director.
