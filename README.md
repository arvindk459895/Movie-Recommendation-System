## Introduction ##

The aim of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that can provide movie recommendations to users based on their past viewing history and preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to generate recommendations for users.

Collaborative filtering is a technique that uses the past behavior of users to generate recommendations. It identifies users who have similar preferences and recommends movies that they have liked in the past. Content-based filtering, on the other hand, recommends movies based on their attributes such as genre, cast, and director.

## Technologies Used ##

Python 3.8

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

## Dataset ##
The dataset used in this project is the MovieLens dataset. It contains over 5000 movie ratings from users of the MovieLens website. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).
